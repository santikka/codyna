An R package for the analysis of complex dynamic systems with a focus on the temporal unfolding of patterns, changes, and state transitions in behavioral data. The package supports both time-series and sequence data and provides tools for the analysis and visualization of complexity, pattern identification, trends, regimes, sequence typology as well as early warning signals.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `codyna` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
